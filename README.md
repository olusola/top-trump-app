### Note
 - Height is not available for player comparison so i used 'crew' field instead
 
### Could Improve 

- Number of players could be increased by updating the 'NoOfPlayers' state. This will be used inside 'getNrandomCards(NoOfPlayers, data)' method which generates N cards from the list of cards.

- Spent some more time improving UI and keeping design consistent;especially the history page.

- More testing is needed

### Important Files/Folders
- Helper file: includes methods
- Constants: includes various types and interfaces. Some of of which are reusable.
- Style: includes all theme constants
